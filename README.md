<h1>Bus Ticket Management System</h1>

<p>Our software project is called <strong>Bus Ticket Management System</strong>. It's an online web app designed to allow users to buy tickets online. It also enables bus service companies to manage various business processes and resources, such as buses, employees, etc. Many companies, such as Unique, Ena, and Greenline, still conduct the majority of their business processes manually. Our software aims to create value in this market by automating most of these processes.</p>
